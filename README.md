# AresAmigos.exe
This file is useful for block CARMELIX.exe, repairs what CARMELIX.exe did (Doesn't recover the lost files), but repairs the registry and renable the protection services that CARMELIX.exe has turned off.

How to use? Just open this fucking file, lol.

Why this file ask administrator permission? Because it have to modify the registry for repair it from CARMELIX.exe.
